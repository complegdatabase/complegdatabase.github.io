<h4 class="legislator-blue">What's new</h4>

With our commitment to expanding the geographic scope of the database, while maintaining up-to-date information available, we have added five new countries to the database. This means that we now cover even more legislative bodies across the world, allowing our users to access a wealth of information about legislators across different nations.

Along with expanding our coverage, we have also made significant improvements under the hood. Our team has been hard at work ensuring that users can access the information they need quickly and efficiently.

The Comparative Legislators Database has always been committed to providing high-quality data to our users, and this update is just another step in our ongoing efforts to offer the most comprehensive and reliable information possible. We hope that you will continue to rely on our database as your trusted source for comparative legislative research.
