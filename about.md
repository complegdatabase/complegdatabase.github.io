<p class="message">
The Comparative Legislators Database (CLD) is a one-stop shop for rich, diverse and integrated individual-level data on national political representatives. The database contains information for over 45,000 contemporary and historical legislators from 14 countries and the European Parliament. In our project, we unite collaborative micro-data collection efforts. We bring these together through the use of Wikipedia and Wikidata.

We can provide a brief overview of the project and your vision for the future here!
